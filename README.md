# Semantic-Document-Retrieval-Using-Latent-Semantic-Indexing-LSI-
In this project, we leverage Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to enable semantic document retrievalâ€”helping users find relevant documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords. Starting with a collection of text documents, we parse each to extract titles, authors, and main content. Through a series of pre-processing steps, including tokenization, lowercasing, and removing common words, the documents are cleaned and standardized. Using Gensim's dictionary and bag-of-words techniques, we then convert these documents into a form ready for semantic analysis. Applying LSI uncovers underlying topics, enhancing document retrieval by identifying similar documents and relevant themes. This approach is ideal for applications like research, academic exploration, and content discovery, where finding information based on concept rather than specific terms adds significant value.
